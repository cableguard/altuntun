# Altuntun

**Altuntun** is an implementation of the [WireGuard<sup>Â®</sup>](https://www.wireguard.com/) protocol, and consists of two parts:
* The executable `altuntun-cli`, a [userspace WireGuard](https://www.wireguard.com/xplatform/) implementation for Linux and macOS.
* The library `altuntun` that implements the underlying WireGuard protocol, without the network or tunnel stacks that need to be that need to be implemented in a platform idiomatic way.

## How to Install from Source
- sudo apt install pkg-config
- git clone https://github.com/cableguard/altuntun.git
- cargo build --bin altuntun-cli --release
By default the executable is placed in the `./target/release` folder. You can copy it to a desired location manually, or install it using `cargo install --bin altuntun --path .`.

You may want to add to .bashrc these lines:
- sudo setcap cap_net_admin+epi ./<path>/altuntun-cli

## How to Install from .deb package
wget https://altuntun.fra1.digitaloceanspaces.com/altuntun-cli_0.89.99_amd64.deb
sudo apt install ./altuntun-cli_0.92.58_amd64.deb

## How to Use
To start a tunnel use:
`altuntun-cli [-f/--foreground] ADDFROMBORINGTUN`

`altuntun` will drop privileges when started. When privileges are dropped it is not possible to set `fwmark`. If `fwmark` is required, such as when using `wg-quick`, run with `--disable-drop-privileges` or set the environment variable `WG_SUDO=1`.
You will need to give the executable the `CAP_NET_ADMIN` capability using: `sudo setcap cap_net_admin+epi altuntun`.

You can use [wg-quick](https://git.zx2c4.com/WireGuard/about/src/tools/man/wg-quick.8) by setting the environment variable `WG_QUICK_USERSPACE_IMPLEMENTATION` to `altuntun`. For example:
`sudo WG_QUICK_USERSPACE_IMPLEMENTATION=altuntun-cli WG_SUDO=1 wg-quick up CONFIGURATION`

## Supported platforms
- It has only been tested in AMD/Intel
- `x86-64` architecture is supported.
